                <p>I am a junior computer science student at KFUPM. I like travelling, watching football, playing video games, 
                    and discovering new things.
                </p>

                     Spending time on developing my skills in computer science is important for me. 
                    I like the feeling of accomplishing a new task after many hours of hard work.
                    It always motivates me to do more and work harder.
